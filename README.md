Create a PhotoGallery component.
- The PhotoGallery component should take in an array of images.
- Each image will have a url and a caption.
- The captions should be displayed over the image.
- The PhotoGallery should allow users to either click or swipe through images.
- Bonus credit for smoothly animating the swipe and transition between images.
- Handle any edge cases you can think of.
